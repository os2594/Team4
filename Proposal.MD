# 📝 Project Proposal: Marimo

---

## 🌟 Introduction

Marimo is a modern, **reactive Python notebook environment** designed to improve upon traditional tools like Jupyter.  
Unlike conventional notebooks that often suffer from hidden state and reproducibility issues, Marimo emphasizes:

- **Reproducibility**: All notebooks are stored as pure Python (`.py`) files, making them transparent, version-controllable, and auditable.  
- **Reactive Execution**: A built-in dependency graph ensures that when a cell changes, all dependent cells are automatically re-executed. This eliminates hidden state and reduces user error.  
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Notebooks can run in “edit mode” for developers, “read-only mode” for safe sharing, or even fully in-browser using WebAssembly (Pyodide).  
- **Security Awareness**: Features such as token-based access, TLS/SSL support, encrypted backups, and custom authentication middleware make it suitable for sensitive environments where trust and assurance matter.  

Marimo is actively developed and widely adopted in research, education, and enterprise data science workflows. Its focus on **assurance, transparency, and collaboration** makes it a strong candidate for evaluating real-world security needs in multi-user, enterprise, and regulated environments.

## 🔐 Security Needs, Threats, and Features
- **Security Needs**: Identify what organizations require from Marimo in this environment (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, auditability).
- **Threats**: List potential risks perceived by users (e.g., unauthorized access, data leakage, malicious code execution).
- **Security Features**: Summarize the features already present in Marimo that address these needs (auth, TLS, hidden state elimination, etc.).

## 📋 Project Planning, Tracking & Reflection
- **Planning & Tracking**: Use GitHub Project Board to assign tasks, link issues, and monitor progress.
- **Reflection**: Each member adds an individual reflection:
  - What did I learn from this assignment?
  - What was most useful to me?  
- **Team Reflection**: Compile into one section showing group learning outcomes.
