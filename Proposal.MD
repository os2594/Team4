# üìù Project Proposal: Marimo

---

## üåü Introduction

Marimo is a modern, **reactive Python notebook environment** designed to improve upon traditional tools like Jupyter.Unlike conventional notebooks that often suffer from hidden state and reproducibility issues, Marimo emphasizes:

- **Reproducibility**: All notebooks are stored as pure Python (`.py`) files, making them transparent, version-controllable, and auditable.
- **Reactive Execution**: A built-in dependency graph ensures that when a cell changes, all dependent cells are automatically re-executed. This eliminates hidden state and reduces user error.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Notebooks can run in ‚Äúedit mode‚Äù for developers, ‚Äúread-only mode‚Äù for safe sharing, or even fully in-browser using WebAssembly (Pyodide).
- **Security Awareness**: Features such as token-based access, TLS/SSL support, encrypted backups, and custom authentication middleware make it suitable for sensitive environments where trust and assurance matter.

Marimo is actively developed and widely adopted in research, education, and enterprise data science workflows. Its focus on **assurance, transparency, and collaboration** makes it a strong candidate for evaluating real-world security needs in multi-user, enterprise, and regulated environments.

## üè¢ Hypothetical Operational Environment

Describe the enterprise, hospital, government, or research setting in which Marimo will be deployed, focusing on how users expect security functionality.

- The hypothetical environment chosen for this project is a Bank, where users would use Marimo software as an enterprise analytics software.
- A bank's analytics team uses Marimo as a tool to process financial and customer data. In this situation the security features expected are sensitive data must remain confidential and in some cases encrypted depending on the type of data. The audit logs must be tracked to ensure proper utilization and access management policies. In case of any apps or software were linked to the tool, proper authentication must happen so that only authorized members are able to access data and environment.

## üîê Security Needs, Threats, and Features

- **Security Needs**: Identify what organizations require from Marimo in this environment (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, auditability).
- **Threats**: List potential risks perceived by users (e.g., unauthorized access, data leakage, malicious code execution).
- **Security Features**: Summarize the features already present in Marimo that address these needs (auth, TLS, hidden state elimination, etc.).

## üéØ Team Motivation

Explain why your group selected Marimo:

- Popularity and active development
- Enterprise or educational use cases
- Clear security considerations
- Rich opportunities for assurance analysis

## üìã Project Planning, Tracking & Reflection

- **Planning & Tracking**: Use GitHub Project Board to assign tasks, link issues, and monitor progress.
- **Reflection**: Each member adds an individual reflection:

  *Justin Tobiason*

  - What did I learn from this assignment?
    - I definetly understand a bit more regarding the information that an OSS needs to share and maintain for both leagal and ehtical reasons.
  - What was most useful to me?
    - The most valuable thing I took away is it's important to incorporate a Contributor License Agreement to ensure that your contributors and open up a civil disagreement about logic they commited.

  *Member 2*

  - What did I learn from this assignment?
  - What was most useful to me?

  *Member 3*

  - What did I learn from this assignment?
  - What was most useful to me?
- **Team Reflection**: Compile into one section showing group learning outcomes.
