## üåü Introduction

Marimo is a modern, **reactive Python notebook environment** designed to improve upon traditional tools like Jupyter.  
Unlike conventional notebooks that often suffer from hidden state and reproducibility issues, Marimo emphasizes:

- **Reproducibility**: All notebooks are stored as pure Python (`.py`) files, making them transparent, version-controllable, and auditable.  
- **Reactive Execution**: A built-in dependency graph ensures that when a cell changes, all dependent cells are automatically re-executed. This eliminates hidden state and reduces user error.  
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Notebooks can run in ‚Äúedit mode‚Äù for developers, ‚Äúread-only mode‚Äù for safe sharing, or even fully in-browser using WebAssembly (Pyodide).  
- **Security Awareness**: Features such as token-based access, TLS/SSL support, encrypted backups, and custom authentication middleware make it suitable for sensitive environments where trust and assurance matter.  

Marimo is actively developed and widely adopted in research, education, and enterprise data science workflows. Its focus on **assurance, transparency, and collaboration** makes it a strong candidate for evaluating real-world security needs in multi-user, enterprise, and regulated environments.

## üè¢ Hypothetical Operational Environment
Describe the enterprise, hospital, government, or research setting in which Marimo will be deployed, focusing on how users expect security functionality.

- The hypothetical environment chosen for this project is a Bank, where users would use Marimo software as an enterprise analytics software.

- A bank's analytics team uses Marimo as a tool to process financial and customer data. In this situation the security features expected are sensitive data must remain confidential and in some cases encrypted depending on the type of data. The audit logs must be tracked to ensure proper utilization and access management policies. In case of any apps or software were linked to the tool, proper authentication must happen so that only authorized members are able to access data and environment.

- **Threats**: List potential risks perceived by users (e.g., unauthorized access, data leakage, malicious code execution).

# Marimo: Security & Assurance Surface

This document evaluates the **security-relevant features** of Marimo from a software assurance and quality perspective.  
The intent is to identify controls, strengths, and gaps that affect assurance in enterprise or regulated environments.

---

## ‚úÖ Security Features

### üîê Authentication & Access Control
- **Token / Password Protection**  
  Marimo servers can be configured with access tokens or passwords. This establishes a basic authentication mechanism, preventing anonymous or casual access to notebooks. From an assurance standpoint, this feature is necessary but should be combined with stronger identity management in sensitive deployments.

- **Custom Authentication via ASGI Middleware**  
  Because Marimo runs as an ASGI application, it can be embedded into frameworks like **FastAPI** or **Starlette**. This makes it possible to integrate with enterprise identity systems (LDAP, SAML, OAuth2, OIDC). In practice, this allows deployment teams to enforce Single Sign-On (SSO) policies, meeting organizational assurance requirements such as HIPAA or NIST 800-53.

- **OAuth / External Identity Provider Support**  
  Documented implementations (e.g., Cloudflare PKCE flows) confirm that Marimo can leverage modern OAuth2 authentication methods. This improves trust in multi-user environments by supporting centralized identity governance and MFA (multi-factor authentication).

---

### üîí Data Transmission & Privacy
- **TLS/SSL Encryption**  
  All data transmitted between the Marimo server and client browsers can be secured with TLS/SSL. This protects credentials, sensitive notebook content, and API keys from interception. Assurance requires verifying that TLS is enabled in production deployments.

- **Encrypted Backups and Disk Storage**  
  Database backups and disks storing encryption keys are encrypted. This reduces the impact of stolen or misplaced backup files. For QA, validation of backup encryption processes should be part of the test plan.

- **Data Deletion Policies**  
  Marimo specifies that deleted accounts and notebooks are purged (typically within 60 days). This control helps enforce data minimization principles and reduces the long-term risk of data exposure.

---

### üåÄ Reproducibility & Hidden State Control
- **Reactive Execution Model**  
  Marimo constructs a dependency graph of notebook cells. When a cell changes, downstream cells are automatically recalculated. This prevents stale data issues that undermine the integrity of analytical outputs. From an assurance perspective, this improves correctness and traceability of results.

- **Elimination of Hidden State**  
  When a cell is deleted, all variables created in that cell are removed from memory. This prevents untracked values from influencing later computations. QA evaluation should confirm this behavior to reduce the risk of reproducibility failures.

- **Pure-Python Notebook Storage**  
  Notebooks are stored as `.py` scripts instead of JSON (`.ipynb`). This makes them easier to review, version control, and audit. Code reviews can identify potential security flaws without dealing with opaque metadata or hidden payloads.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Modes
- **Read-Only Mode**  
  Marimo can run in a restricted mode where notebooks are executed but not editable. This control supports safe sharing of notebooks in environments where modification could introduce errors or malicious code.

- **Editable Mode**  
  Full access mode is available for trusted users. Separating ‚Äúrun‚Äù from ‚Äúedit‚Äù modes creates a clear trust boundary between viewers and developers, which is a critical assurance principle.

- **Browser/WASM Execution**  
  Some deployments allow Marimo to execute directly in the browser using WebAssembly (Pyodide). In this configuration, code runs on the client side, reducing the exposure of backend systems.

- **Public Sharing / Gallery**  
  Public sharing features expand collaboration but widen the threat surface. QA analysis should include risk modeling for scenarios where notebooks are shared beyond organizational boundaries.

---

### üì¶ Dependency & Execution Safety
- **Serialized Package Requirements**  
  Marimo notebooks capture their dependency versions. This supports reproducibility and enables organizations to audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities, a key assurance activity.

- **Virtual Environment Support**  
  Marimo supports execution within Python virtual environments. This isolates dependencies across projects, reducing the risk of conflicts or dependency confusion attacks.

- **Execution Controls for Expensive Cells**  
  Users can disable automatic execution of high-cost cells. This prevents resource exhaustion and improves stability in shared environments. QA scenarios should test these safeguards under load.

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Privacy & Data Protection
- **Encrypted Backups**  
  Backup encryption ensures data is protected if copies are leaked or stolen. This should be verified in operational testing.

- **Secure Deletion Practices**  
  Account cancellation and content deletion result in data being purged. This helps meet privacy regulations and user expectations around data lifecycle.

- **Database Encryption (Limitations)**  
  While backups and keys are encrypted, most ‚Äúlive‚Äù database data is not encrypted at rest. This is a limitation that increases reliance on perimeter and access controls for assurance.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Gaps & Areas to Improve
From a QA and assurance perspective, the following areas require further maturity:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: No built-in multi-role system (admin, editor, viewer). Enterprises must implement externally.  
- **Comprehensive Encryption at Rest**: Database contents should ideally be fully encrypted, not just backups.  
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed logs of user actions and executed code are not yet a first-class feature. Lack of logging reduces accountability.  
- **External Integrations**: Each API or AI integration expands the attack surface. Proper credential management and input sanitization are necessary.  
- **Public Sharing Controls**: Public gallery features require guardrails (sandboxing, scanning, rate limits) to avoid exposure risks.

---

## üìå Assurance Significance
Marimo demonstrates that it is more than a developer utility; it is a platform with **clear security considerations**:
- Identity and authentication are flexible but must be configured carefully.  
- Data integrity is strengthened by reactive execution and hidden state elimination.  
- Confidentiality is protected by TLS and encrypted backups, though gaps remain in encryption at rest.  
- Auditability and compliance require additional controls (RBAC, logging).  

From a software assurance perspective, these features and gaps provide substantial material for evaluating **trust, risk, and assurance in real operational environments**.

## üéØ Team Motivation

For this assignment, our team was required to evaluate and select an open-source software project that offers meaningful opportunities for **security and assurance analysis**. After considering multiple options, we chose **Marimo** because it stood out as both technically innovative and highly relevant to real organizational use cases.

Marimo is a **reactive Python notebook environment** that addresses long-standing issues with tools like Jupyter, including hidden state, reproducibility challenges, and limited auditability. By storing notebooks as pure Python (`.py`) files, Marimo enables greater transparency, version control, and security-aware workflows. Its **reactive execution model** ensures results remain consistent, while deployment modes (edit vs. run-only, server-based vs. browser-based) provide flexibility for both secure collaboration and development.

Our motivation for selecting Marimo is based on several key factors:

- **Popularity and Active Development**  
  Marimo is under active development, with a growing contributor base and regular releases. Its presence on GitHub and in developer communities shows strong momentum and engagement.

- **Enterprise and Educational Use Cases**  
  Marimo is already used across **universities, research institutions, and organizations** that require reproducibility and secure collaboration. Its design also makes it a strong theoretical fit for enterprise and government settings where security and assurance are critical.

- **Clear Security Considerations**  
  Features like token-based authentication, TLS/SSL support, encrypted backups, hidden state elimination, and integration with external identity providers give Marimo a distinct **security surface** to analyze. At the same time, current gaps (RBAC, audit logging, full encryption at rest) provide room to reason about trust and improvement opportunities.

- **Rich Opportunities for Assurance Analysis**  
  Marimo operates at the intersection of code execution, data handling, and collaborative use. This allows us to systematically examine trust boundaries, risk scenarios, and assurance measures across multiple components, from authentication and data privacy to dependency management and deployment controls.

In summary, Marimo was selected because it is not just an innovative notebook tool‚Äîit is a **maturing open-source platform** with real adoption, meaningful security requirements, and clear opportunities for systematic assurance evaluation. This combination makes it an intelligent and well-justified choice for our team‚Äôs project.

    - The most valuable thing I took away is it's important to incorporate a Contributor License Agreement to ensure that your contributors and open up a civil disagreement about logic they commited. 

  *Preeti Timalsina*
  - What did I learn from this assignment?
    - I feel like I understand a little bit better on the specific security needs depending on the hypothetical enviroment and how it can vary with the usecase.
  - What was most useful to me?  
    - One thing I can take away from reviewing this is that security is something that must go hand on hand even though technicnically majority may be focused on the functionality, If security is ignored the whole usecase may discmiss itself for a good project.
